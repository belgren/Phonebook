# Phonebook
This program can be run from the Phonebook.java file. Several additional supporting files are included.

This program allows users to search through a provided csv file with 500 entries containing name and associated contact information.
The program will also correct the input if the name is not found to the most similar entry based on an edit distance algorithm. 
This project utilizes my implementations of a linked list and a hash map, which are included in this repository.
